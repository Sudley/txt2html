*Parsing HTML*

Use the BeautifulSoup class to parse an HTML document. Here are some of the things that BeautifulSoup knows:

 - Some tags can be nested (<BLOCKQUOTE>) and some can't (<P>).

 - Table and list tags have a natural nesting order. For instance, <TD> tags go inside <TR> tags, not the other way around.

 - The contents of a <SCRIPT> tag should not be parsed as HTML.

 - A <META> tag may specify an encoding for the document.
